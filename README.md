# The-Pioneer-Trail
This was a project for CIT 260 class.
We learned basic object-oriented programming while <br>
creating a simple game on with Java. <br>
At the beginning we were a 3-member team <br>
few weeks later there were just 2 of us working on this. <br>

Mahonri Pobee was my partner, our instructor helped us <br>
and constantly provided feedback to us.
